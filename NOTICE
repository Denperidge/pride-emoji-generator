==========

This project uses Zaimki (also known as pronouns.page) as a submodule for a collection of pride flag pngs, which is licensed under the Opinionated Queer License v1.0.
I haven't modified the original source code, and only used the flag png's as a starting point. The license goes as follows, but is also available at https://oql.avris.it/
